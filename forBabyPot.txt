Hey Babypotato!

Welcome to the team. (again)


First things first. You're going to need to install PHP to test run this site.

Please go to https://www.php.net/ and install the software.

Once installed, (and once you're in the eternaments-website directory), you should be able to run the following command.

php -S 127.0.0.1:(any open port number on your network)

Replace the text in parentheses with a port number. I myself use 8000.


The primary coding language that this website is written in is PHP. PHP, (if you don't already know) is a language that is used for backend server-data handling. 

It's formatted EXACTLY the same as HTML, but you can insert inline code into HTML.

PHP code is wrapped by the following.

<?php 
    yourCodeHere;
?>

Otherwise, treat the PHP files as HTML.


Additionally, the website is being managed by a hostmonster CPANEL account. MySQL goes through that.

Locally, please be sure to keep the workspace organized (even though I know mine isn't exactly the most prime example of that)

Meaning, keep new pages (such as signup page), under the pages folder, and vise versa. Keep images in the img folder, if possible.

Additionally, I know comments might be sparse in my code. I'll try to put in some more comments for you as necessary- but please feel free to reach out for help if something doesn't make sense.


Remember to push git updates regularly. (git push origin master for the main branch)



Thanks and happy developing,

Warrior
